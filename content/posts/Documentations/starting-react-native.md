Welcome to my react-native documentation. I will be documenting my jurney into mobile development using react-native as my development language/framework. 

starting from the day I will make a post '#10daysofreactnative #day1' will be posted here, on this Blog.

I choosed to document my jurney by writing blog post to keep me in check. 

Unlike when I tried #100daysofcode challenge, I made use of twitter to document my jurney, but that didn't end well.

I plan to start writing more often from the time of this post.
